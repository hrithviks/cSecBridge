/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * CSecBridge Database Initialization Script
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * This script is responsible for bootstrapping the PostgreSQL database schema
 * for the CSecBridge application. It creates all necessary roles, tables,
 * indexes, and permissions required for the services to function.
 *
 * EXECUTION LIFECYCLE:
 * This script is designed to be executed ONLY ONCE, during the very first
 * startup of the PostgreSQL container against an empty data volume. The
 * official PostgreSQL Docker image's entrypoint handles this automatically.
 *
 * STATE MANAGEMENT AND PERSISTENCE:
 * In a Kubernetes environment, this container is deployed as a StatefulSet
 * with a PersistentVolumeClaim. This ensures that the database's data
 * directory (/var/lib/postgresql/data) is stored on a durable, persistent
 * volume outside the container's lifecycle.
 *
 * On subsequent restarts or redeployments, the new container will attach to
 * the existing persistent volume. Since the data directory is not empty, the
 * entrypoint script will SKIP the execution of this init.sql file, thereby
 * preserving the database's state.
 * 
 * NAMING CONVENTIONS:
 * All custom database objects created for this application - users, tables, 
 * indexes etc. should be prefixed with 'csb_' to avoid conflicts and 
 * improve clarity. Columns are excluded from this convention for readability.
 *
